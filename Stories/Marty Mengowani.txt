My name is Marty Mengowani and I’m a local businessman from Mlolongo, Kenya. I sell fruits and vegetables from my small family farm. Ever since I was a young boy I always wanted to go study and make a better future for myself. As time went on I found it impossible to get the time and money to further my education, and I had to focus on providing for my family. I have a son who is now coming of age to be able to further his tertiary education and I promised myself that no matter what, I’d find a way for him to study and become successful.

My son is clever, just like his old man – and I want to be able to path a way for his future. Taking out this loan will start him off right and he won’t have to worry about his future because I promised him that I’d find a way.
