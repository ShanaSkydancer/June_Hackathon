# June Hackathon
## Team Awesome

# Our solution:
Create a webapp for Jumo users to be able to share their stories.
Jumo admin will them be able to access the stories via specific categories.

## Who:
Persona 1:
Umar the Local businessman

Persona 2:
Allan the Jumo employee

## What Information/Data:
The Jumo admin will be able to filter through stories and access data based off of what they are looking for from a category and keywords.

## How does it help to understand our customers:
By allowing Jumo users to tell their story in different platforms, Jumo will be able to get a better understanding of who they give micro loans to and why the Jumo user wants to get the loan. Jumo will then be able to better empathise with their customers and by getting this information they can produce a better product for their customers.
