This is my story – Stephanie Benny. Every morning I wake up very early, before dawn and I walk 3 hours to the market to buy wool to be able to weave blankets. Within a few days I have been able to knit a couple of blankets and I’ll walk back to the market to sell my blankets. They usually get sold within one day at the market. I keep doing this to save money to be able to buy myself a scooter so that I can travel to the market easier and I’ll then have more time on my hands to knit more blankets.

I want to get a scooter sooner because it’ll speed up the process of buy and selling and allow me to make more profit in the long run.
